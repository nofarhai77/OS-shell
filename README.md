# OS-shell
Implementation of a simple shell program. Written in C as an assignment in operating-systems course (Tel Aviv University).

# Main purpose
The goal of this assignment is to gain experience with process management, pipes, signals, and the relevant system calls.  
We will implement a simple shell program, a function that receives a shell command and performs it and initialization/finalization code that required.  
Those will be prepare, process_arglist and finalize functions. others will be auxilary functions.  
We also receive a skeleton shell program (shell.c) that reads lines from the user, parses them into commands, and invokes the function we write.
